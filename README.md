# datalib

Datalib is a JavaScript data utility library. It provides facilities for data loading, type inference, common statistics, and string templates. While created to power [Vega](http://vega.github.io) and related projects, datalib is a standalone library useful for data-driven JavaScript applications on both the client (web browser) and server (e.g., node.js).
